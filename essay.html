<h1>The "Perfect" Enemy</h1>
<h3>by Coach S.</h3>
<div id="message" style="font-size: 1em">
<p>I think it started in the fourth grade. The teacher, Mrs. Watts, passed out our report cards just before the bell rang. 
While my classmates eagerly opened theirs, I hesitated. I had a bad feeling about my grades.  I tucked the report card inside one of my books 
and quickly headed out the door. I wanted to avoid having to face any of my academic rivals. I was sure their report cards were perfect. 
I didn’t want them to ask me about mine.</p>

<p>On the way home the tension of not knowing became too great to bear. I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and opened up my report card. 
And there it was. My greatest fear realized. In the middle of a list of perfectly formed cursive "A"s was that dreaded grade. It stood 
out like a giant pimple on the tip of my nose. A "B". In English. I had never received a "B" in any subject in any grade. I had been a perfect student. 
Now I had an ugly blemish on my perfect record, and one that could not be removed.</p>

<p>I was overcome with emotion. I started crying. When I got home, I couldn’t face my mother. I ran back into my bedroom, hurled myself onto the bed, 
and buried my imperfect head into the pillow. When my mom discovered what was wrong, she tried to console me. She pointed out all the "A"s. She said how 
proud she was of me. She counted out the quarters I earned for each "A, but all I could think about was the lousy dime I got for that "B."</p>

<p>Perfection. It has haunted me for a long time. Not just in my academic life, but in many other areas. Creating songlists for retreats. Preparing talks. 
Writing "Thoughts for the Day."" Developing programming case studies for my classes. I want each song, each word, each line of code to be perfect. 
The problem is, perfection is a concept, an ideal. Remember what Jesus said, "Nobody is perfect except the Father." </p>

<p>The pursuit of perfection, taken to the extreme, can have very negative consequences. It can result in paralysis, not being able to take the next 
step because you haven't perfected the first step. Or it can cause endless reworking of some artifact, like rewriting a sentence over and over 
again to get it just right. Worst of all, it may lead to discouragement and even abandonment. If you are not careful, the pursuit of perfection 
can become the primary cause of failure.</p>

<p>There is a saying: The perfect is the enemy of the good. Yes, an "A" is perfect, but a "B" is pretty good. It signifies a level of mastery above what 
is normally expected. It should yield feelings of satisfaction. Focusing on not earning an "A" destroys the well-being, the sense of accomplishment 
that should naturally arise. It becomes the enemy.</p>

<p>As with academics, this also applies to running. You have performance goals. You have high expectations of yourselves. You want to have that perfect race. 
You want to get that perfect time. Great. Go for it. Do everything you can to grab the loaf. But don't let perfection become your enemy. Don't let perfection 
mock your efforts. Don't let perfection rob you of the joy of becoming the best runner you can be. Rejoicing in a good performance is always better than 
despairing over an imperfect one. So let the good be your friend. </p>
